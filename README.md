# RetroArch-Overlay-For-J2ME

RetroArch overlay for FreeJ2ME-Plus.

It's terrible to put a vertical screen phone on a horizontal screen...

So, I cut off the phone to ensure that we can enjoy a larger resolution visually.

I'm a newbie at overlays and my work is clumsy, but I'm still learning :D

## List
[Overlay List](https://github.com/Magstic/RetroArch-Overlay-For-J2ME/blob/main/)

## How to use?
1. Customize scaling for each resolution(1080P):
- 128x128: "Custom width: 384" "Custom height: 384"
- 128x160: "Custom width: 384" "Custom height: 480"
- 176x208: "Custom width: 528" "Custom height: 624"
- 240x320: "Custom width: 480" "Custom height: 640"
- 360x640: "Custom width: 1280" "Custom height: 720"
...

The actual situation is more complicated, please modify it according to the screen resolution of your personal PC.


2. Load the Overlay in-game and after fine-tuning it, save it as Overrides.

You may want to categorize your games by their resolution, and then store the overrides as path specific.


## Touch buttons?
Are you using a touch-enabled... Windows or Linux tablet?

In any case, the overlay (mask) can only provide visual enhancement effects at present, and touch is too useless...

Even so, this table may be useful:

|  Core Button  | XBox360 | cfg file  |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ |
| OK      | A          | y      |
| RS      | B          | start  |
| LS      | Back       | select |
| 0       | start      | x      |
| 1       | LT         | l1     |
| 3       | RT         | r1     |
| 5       | A         | l3     |
| 7       | X          | b      |
| 9       | Y          | a      |
| *       | LB         | l2     |
| #       | RB         | r2     |
| UP      | LJoy UP    | up     |
| DOWN    | LJoy DOWN  | down   |
| LEFT    | LJoy LEFT  | left   |
| RIGHT   | LJoy RIGHT | right  |
| 2-4-6-8 | D-Pad      | ？      |

The key values ​​of 『2/4/6/8』 may not be supported by RetroArch's overlay parameters.


## Finish?
